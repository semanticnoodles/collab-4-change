While the individual depicted is identified as possibly James Still, the creator field is empty (“nan”), leaving unknown who captured the photograph. Additionally, the abstract provides limited context on the setting or significance of the image beyond identifying the subject as a pharmacist/chemist. Including more details on the photographer and the historical context could enhance the richness and depth of the metadata description.\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini\nScore: 3\nFeedback: While the metadata does mention James Still, an African American pharmacist, it predominantly focuses on his professional identity and does not explore broader social contexts, other figures, or relationships that may provide a richer narrative. The lack of detail on the individual’s background or contributions to the field creates a moderate gap in representation, particularly in acknowledging the collective experiences of African American pharmacists and chemists during that era.\n\n\nCommand R+\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata for this item provide a relatively clear and balanced understanding of the subject matter. The title and abstract offer context on the individual’s profession, attire, and potential identity, with appropriate use of qualifiers like “possibly” and “African American” to provide nuance. The date and subject fields also add valuable context. However, a minor gap lies in the lack of detail about the object itself, its format, and any distinctive features. Enhancing the description with these details would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the item and its contents. The score of 4.0 reflects the generally inclusive nature of the description, with room for minor enhancements to ensure a more complete representation of the object.\n\n\n\nTimeliness\n\nGPT-3.5 Turbo\nScore: 3\nFeedback: Qualitative Commentary The term “African American” is appropriately used throughout the metadata to describe individuals of African descent. However, the use of the term “chemists” may be seen as limiting and potentially not accurate when referring to someone practicing the profession of pharmacy, which would have been more common during that time. The metadata also includes the term “men” in relation to African Americans, which can be seen as reductive and overlooks the diversity within this community. While the term “bow ties” is neutral, the use of terms like “poss.” as a short form for “possible” lacks clarity and precision. It’s essential to provide clear and accurate information in the metadata to avoid perpetuating stereotypes or inaccuracies.\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini\nScore: 5\nFeedback: Commentary The metadata description is respectful and accurately represents the individual identified, James Still, without employing outdated or harmful terminology. The subjects and topics utilized focus on identity and profession in a factual manner, avoiding language that might perpetuate stereotypes or biases. The respectful context enhances the archival integrity of the collection, fostering positive representation of African American individuals in historical records.\n\n\nCommand R+\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata for this item from the Robert Langmuir African American Photograph Collection contains minimal instances of harmful language. The term “African American” is currently widely accepted and used, but it is important to acknowledge that this terminology has evolved over time and varies based on individual and community preferences. While not harmful, it is worth noting that the use of “African American” may not reflect the self-identified terminology of the individual depicted, particularly given the historical context of the photograph. Additionally, the abbreviation “Febry” for February is outdated and could be expanded to avoid confusion.\nThe score of 4 is assigned because the language used is mostly neutral and factual, with only a minor note of a potentially outdated term relating to the individual’s identity. The metadata focuses on describing the content of the photograph and providing relevant context, which is an important aspect of making the collection discoverable and accessible to users. However, it is always important to remain vigilant and critically evaluate the language used in archival descriptions to ensure that it aligns with current best practices and does not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\nGPT-3.5 Turbo\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata provided is mostly accessible as it includes clear and descriptive language related to the image content. The title provides a brief description of the photograph with the name of the subject and their profession. The abstract gives additional context by mentioning the possible identity of the person depicted, along with the date. The use of terms like “pharmacist/chemist,” “African American,” and “bow ties” helps in identifying the key elements of the image. The presence of some abbreviations could slightly hinder understandability, but overall, the metadata effectively conveys relevant information about the image.\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata is mostly clear, using plain language to describe the subject and context, which aids accessibility. However, the abbreviation “Poss.” may cause confusion, and there is a lack of a clear creator’s name. Overall, the information is well-organized and facilitates understanding, warranting a score of 4.\n\n\nCommand R+\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata for this item from the Robert Langmuir African American Photograph Collection is largely written in clear and plain language, with concise and descriptive fields. The use of the word “verso” may be unclear to some users and could be expanded upon to increase accessibility further. Additionally, the abbreviation “nan” in the Creator field should be written out for clarity and to maintain consistency with the rest of the metadata. The score is primarily influenced by the concise and descriptive language used in the metadata, which effectively communicates the content and context of the photograph. The item-specific details, such as the date, subject, and topics, are particularly strong and contribute to the overall accessibility."

However, there are some minor imbalances in the lack of detail regarding the two men depicted in the image. Including more information about these individuals would enhance the completeness of the description.\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini\nScore: 3\nFeedback: The metadata reflects a focus on David Livingstone, a male historical figure, which neglects the broader context of the individuals depicted in the sculpture and their potential cultural significance. Additionally, there is no representation of the sad person‚Äôs identity or experience, limiting the emotional depth and cultural narratives present in the image. This leads to a moderate gap in inclusivity.\n\n\nCommand R+\nScore: 3\nFeedback: The metadata for this item presents a moderately comprehensive description of the object, conveying its key features and themes. However, there are gaps and imbalances in the representation of people that result in a lower score. While the title mentions “two men and a sad person,” there is an absence of descriptive detail about these individuals, particularly regarding their cultural background and relationship to each other. The use of “sad person” is also dehumanizing and fails to provide a respectful representation of the individual. Additionally, the creator of the work is listed as “nan,” indicating missing or unknown information, which can hinder a comprehensive understanding of the item’s context and significance. Overall, while the metadata touches on important aspects, the lack of detailed and respectful descriptions of the individuals depicted, as well as the missing creator information, results in a score of 3.\n\n\n\nTimeliness\n\nGPT-3.5 Turbo\nScore: 3\nFeedback: The metadata for the photograph contains language that may be considered potentially harmful or outdated. Terms like “coloured sculpture tableaux” could be seen as outdated and perpetuate racial stereotypes by emphasizing the race of the sculptures unnecessarily. Additionally, the term “sad person” to describe an individual in the photograph is vague and lacking sensitivity. While these instances are not severely harmful, they do point to a need for more thoughtful and inclusive language choices in describing individuals and artworks in the collection. The reference to “nan” as the creator is uninformative and lacks specificity, which could be addressed by further research to provide a more accurate attribution. There is a need for more inclusive and descriptive language that respects the identities and experiences of the individuals and subjects depicted in the collection.\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata primarily employs neutral language pertaining to a historical figure and artwork, with minimal concerns. The term “coloured” is outdated and can be seen as problematic, but it reflects a historical context rather than intentional harm. Overall, the language is mostly respectful and descriptive, meriting a score of 4 for minimal instances of potentially harmful language.\n\n\nCommand R+\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The term ‘coloured’ stands out as a word that is no longer used due to its harmful connotations and the potential to perpetuate racial stereotypes. The word is outdated and carries a historical weight of othering and discrimination. However, the instance is minimal and isolated, and the overall language used in the metadata is relatively neutral and descriptive.\nWhile the term ‘coloured’ is not as aggressive or overtly offensive as some racial slurs, it is a word that has been used historically to dehumanize and marginalize people of color, particularly those of African descent. The term implies a separation and ‘otherness’ that contributes to a long history of racial discrimination and the legacy of colonialism.\nThe usage here is likely a reflection of the time period in which the sculpture was created and the metadata was first written, and it is important to acknowledge that language norms and sensitivities have evolved since then. Reevaluating and updating the language used in archival descriptions is an essential step in ensuring that these collections are inclusive and accessible to all users, particularly those from marginalized communities who have been historically underrepresented in archives.\nThe minimal score reflects the isolated nature of the instance and the overall neutral tone of the remaining metadata. However, it is important to remain vigilant and continue assessing and updating language to ensure an inclusive archival space.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\nGPT-3.5 Turbo\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata is mostly accessible as it provides clear and detailed information about the photograph. The use of plain language in describing the scene depicted in the image, as well as providing relevant context such as the date, creator, and subjects, enhances the accessibility. However, the absence of a creator name and the use of ‘nan’ could be improved to provide a more complete understanding. Overall, the metadata facilitates understanding of the content depicted in the photograph.\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini\nScore: 3\nFeedback: The metadata is mostly clear, but some terms may not be immediately understandable to all audiences, such as “tableaux” and “coloured sculpture tableaux.” The inclusion of specific historical references assumes a level of prior knowledge. Additionally, “nan” as a creator is non-informative. Overall, while it provides essential information, it could benefit from simpler language for broader accessibility.\n\n\nCommand R+\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata for this item from the Robert Langmuir African American Photograph Collection is mostly accessible. The language used is clear and concise, with no apparent use of obsolete terms or abbreviations that would hinder understanding. The title and abstract provide a descriptive and contextual overview of the item, and the date and subject fields are straightforward.\nHowever, there is room for improvement to make the metadata more inclusive and accessible. A minor issue is the lack of capitalization in the title, which could be adjusted to follow title capitalization conventions for improved readability. Additionally, while the term “coloured” in the abstract may have been used accurately in the historical context of the item, it is now considered outdated and potentially offensive. The field could be revised to provide a more contemporary and sensitive description.\nOverall, the metadata is mostly accessible, but small revisions could enhance its clarity and sensitivity."

The absence of specific names, relationships, or broader societal context creates moderate gaps in representation and understanding. While it acknowledges racial identity, it could provide deeper insights into the subject’s historical significance, roles, or contributions.\n\n\nCommand R+\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata for this item provide a relatively clear and balanced description of the object and its key features. The title and abstract sections offer specific details about the photograph, including the photographer’s information, the date, and the address, which provide context for the creation of the portrait. The description also appropriately acknowledges the subject as an African American woman, addressing her racial identity and gender. This information is essential for users seeking images of a specific demographic group.\nHowever, the score of 4 is given due to the potential for further detail in the description. While the basic attributes of the subject are mentioned, there is room for a more nuanced and comprehensive representation. Additional details about the woman’s expression, clothing, or any notable features in the photograph could enhance the description, providing a more holistic understanding of the image.

The absence of subjects in the “Subjects” field is concerning as it limits the specificity and access points for users looking for relevant content. The term “African American women” is used, which reflects a more contemporary and respectful language choice. However, the metadata lacks depth in describing the content, focusing more on the photographer information rather than the depicted individual. This lack of descriptive detail can perpetuate invisibility and contribute to the dehumanization of the subject.\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini\nScore: 5\nFeedback: The metadata does not contain any outdated or harmful terms; specific descriptors appropriately identify the subject matter.

The term “African American” in the title and subject fields is currently the preferred nomenclature and is not harmful. However, the abbreviation “nan” in the Subjects field could be considered outdated and mildly harmful as it may obscure the context and significance of the photograph. This score of 4 indicates that the language used in these metadata is mostly inclusive and free of harmful connotations, with only minor improvements needed to enhance its inclusivity further.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\nGPT-3.5 Turbo\nScore: 3\nFeedback: The metadata provides detailed information about the photograph, including the photographer, location, date, and awards received.

The inclusion of more specific subject information would enhance the accessibility of the metadata.\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata is mostly accessible as it uses clear language with minimal jargon. However, the abbreviation “nan” under subjects is confusing and does not offer any information. The metadata communicates key details about the photograph effectively, making it understandable for most users. Overall, only minor issues affect its clarity.\n\n\nCommand R+\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata for this item from the Robert Langmuir African American Photograph Collection is largely written in clear and plain language, with most of the content being readily understandable by users. The title accurately describes the image, and the abstract provides additional context, such as the photographer’s information and the date. Technical terms like “recto” and “verso” may need further explanation for a non-expert audience, and the abbreviation “No.” could be expanded to “Number” to enhance clarity. Overall, the metadata is mostly accessible, but some minor revisions could be considered to ensure a more inclusive and understandable description of the item."

    "text": "Criteria\n\nCompleteness\n\nGPT-3.5 Turbo\nScore: 2\nFeedback: The metadata provided shows a significant imbalance in how people are described. While the creator, Netty A. King, is mentioned, there is no information on the African American boys and men depicted in the photograph. Including descriptors such as age, clothing, activities, or any other relevant details about the individuals would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the photograph and the people in it. The lack of information about the subjects reduces the richness and depth of the metadata, highlighting a significant gap in the description.\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini\nScore: 3\nFeedback: The metadata lacks comprehensive subject descriptors beyond the mention of African American boys and men, with no additional context about the depicted individuals in the photograph. There’s an absence of diverse roles, identities, or cultural backgrounds that can be gleaned from the image, leading to moderate gaps in representation. Furthermore, the subjects are not fully specified, reducing the richness of the collection.\n\n\nCommand R+\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata for this item provide a relatively clear and balanced understanding of who is depicted in the photograph. The presence of individuals is explicitly stated in the “Subjects” and “Topics” fields, with a specific focus on African American boys and men. This is an important and often overlooked aspect of descriptive metadata, especially in historical collections.\nHowever, the score of 4 (“Minor Imbalances”) is given due to a slight imbalance in the level of detail provided. While the gender and age of the subjects are mentioned (“boys” and “men”), there is room for improvement in describing other aspects, such as their activities, relationships, or any other relevant context. Enhancing these descriptive elements would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the content and context of the photograph.\n\n\n\nTimeliness\n\nGPT-3.5 Turbo\nScore: 2\nFeedback: The terms “African American boys” and “African American men” are descriptive but are lacking context and can be seen as reductionist. By using collective terms like “boys” and “men,” individual identities and experiences are not recognized. Additionally, the lack of specific subject information limits the representation of African American individuals in a diverse and nuanced manner. While the terms themselves are not overtly harmful, they contribute to the broader issue of flattening diverse identities within the African American community. A more detailed and specific description could provide a richer and more respectful representation of the individuals depicted in the images.\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini\nScore: 5\nFeedback: Commentary The metadata for this photograph uses terms that are currently acceptable, such as “African American boys” and “African American men.” There are no outdated or harmful language instances that perpetuate stereotypes. However, the absence of specific subjects could be a missed opportunity for deeper contextualization of the individuals depicted.\n\n\nCommand R+\nScore: 5\nFeedback: Response The metadata for this item from the Robert Langmuir African American Photograph Collection does not contain any severely harmful language or terms with harmful connotations. The language used is factual and descriptive, focusing on the creator, date, and subjects of the photograph. Terms like “African American boys” and “African American men” are appropriate and respectful, and there are no stereotypes or biases present in the provided information. This metadata entry appears to have been crafted with care and an awareness of inclusive language practices.\nWhile it is always important to be mindful of the potential for harm when describing sensitive content, in this case, the metadata curator has successfully avoided any harmful language that could perpetuate negative stereotypes or contribute to offensive representations. Thus, a score of 5 (“No Harmful Language”) is assigned to this metadata entry.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\nGPT-3.5 Turbo\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata is mostly accessible as it provides clear and straightforward information about the photograph. The title and abstract include relevant details such as the location (Charleston, S.C.), the creator (Netty A. King), and the date (October 1870). The presence of acronyms or obsolete language is minimal, making it easy for users to understand the content of the photograph. The subjects and topics listed are simple and directly related to the image, enhancing the overall accessibility of the metadata.\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini\nScore: 3\nFeedback: The metadata achieves moderate accessibility as it provides essential information about the image, including the title, creator, date, and relevant subjects. However, the absence of a proper subject description and the use of “nan” indicate a lack of specific context, which might confuse users. The acronyms ‚ÄúS.C.‚Äù could be clearer by spelling out “South Carolina.” Overall, while functional, the clarity could be improved for fuller understanding.\n\n\nCommand R+\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata for this item from the Robert Langmuir African American Photograph Collection is mostly accessible. The language used is clear and concise, with no apparent use of obsolete terms or complex jargon that would hinder understanding. The fields are appropriately filled out, with the title providing a straightforward description of the image and the abstract offering additional context, including the creator’s name and the date. The only potential barrier to accessibility is the acronym “S.C.” in the title, which may not be immediately clear to all users. However, given the standard usage and context, the acronym is likely understandable by most, and the overall impact on accessibility is minimal. The metadata also effectively incorporates descriptive archival principles, with a focus on providing accurate and accessible information about the photograph’s content and context. The only suggested improvement for a higher score is to spell out “South Carolina” instead of using the abbreviation, enhancing clarity for a broader audience."

However, the lack of information on her background or the context of the photograph creates minor imbalances in the description. Adding details about her significance or the purpose of the photo would help provide a more comprehensive understanding. The metadata focuses more on the studio and location than on Sister Johnson herself, resulting in a slight imbalance.\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini\nScore: 3\nFeedback: The metadata primarily focuses on Sister Johnson, indicating her role and identity, which is a positive aspect. However, it lacks broader contextual information about her and the significance of her attire, reducing understanding of her influence. Additionally, it could encompass more about the collective experiences of African American women rather than solely one individual.\n\n\nCommand R+\nScore: 3\nFeedback: The metadata for this item presents a moderately comprehensive description of the photograph, capturing essential details such as the subject’s name, attire, and posture. However, there are gaps and imbalances that impact the inclusivity of the description. While the title mentions “Sister Johnson,” it does not provide her first name, which could be an important aspect of her identity. The use of the title “Sister” without further context may imply a religious affiliation, but it is unclear if this is accurate or respectful without additional information.\nFurthermore, the description “wearing a robe” is vague and could be expanded upon to provide a more inclusive and accurate representation of the subject’s attire. Is it a religious habit, a ceremonial garment, or simply a personal fashion choice? More detail would help convey a more nuanced understanding of the photograph.\nLastly, the absence of contextual information about Sister Johnson’s life, experiences, and relationship to the photographer or studio could contribute to an imbalance in the representation of her identity. Additional details could enhance the depth and inclusivity of the description, providing a more holistic understanding of the subject and her story.\n\n\n\nTimeliness\n\nGPT-3.5 Turbo\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The term “Negro” appears to be missing from this metadata record, which is a positive sign, as it is a term that carries historical negative connotations and is no longer considered appropriate. However, the term “African American women” is used, which is generally accepted as a more inclusive and respectful way to refer to Black women in the United States. “Robes” and “Johnson” are neutral terms. Overall, the language used in this metadata is fairly modern and respectful, with only minimal instances of potentially harmful language.\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini\nScore: 5\nFeedback: The metadata for this photograph appears to use neutral terms that do not carry harmful connotations or perpetuate negative stereotypes. The description focuses on the subject’s attire and location without employing outdated or derogatory language. Overall, it maintains respect for the individual’s identity and context, aligning well with contemporary inclusive standards in archival practice.\n\n\nCommand R+\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata for this item from the Robert Langmuir African American Photograph Collection contains minimal instances of harmful language. The term “Sister” in the title and description might be considered outdated, but it is not inherently harmful and could be contextual to the subject’s life or the time period. The usage of “African American women” in the “Topics” field is appropriate and indicative of inclusive language. However, the singular usage of “Johnson” in the “Subjects” field without a title or last name could be seen as a minor oversight. The use of a full name or a title with the last name would have been more respectful and formal. Overall, the language used in these metadata is mostly respectful and does not contain severe instances of harmful or outdated terminology.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\nGPT-3.5 Turbo\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata is mostly accessible as it provides detailed information about the photograph in a clear and straightforward manner. The title describes the image, the abstract includes key details such as the studio name, location, dates, and subject’s name. The use of abbreviations like ‘Md.’ for Maryland may slightly hinder understandability for some users but overall the metadata effectively conveys relevant information about the photograph.\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini\nScore: 3\nFeedback: The metadata includes jargon such as “Recto” and “Verso,” which may confuse users unfamiliar with photographic terminology. The use of specific addresses and studio references also complicates understandability. While it provides essential details about the photograph, simplifying language and reducing redundancy would enhance accessibility for broader audiences. Overall, it partially meets archival descriptive standards.\n\n\nCommand R+\nScore: 4\nFeedback: The metadata for this item from the Robert Langmuir African American Photograph Collection is largely written in clear and plain language, with a concise title and abstract providing key details about the photograph. The use of the phrase “Sister Johnson” in the title and the subject field may require additional context for some users but is clear and not obstructed by jargon or complex sentence structure. The date and location are also presented in a standard and understandable format. The only acronym/abbreviation present is “Md.” for Maryland, which is a standard abbreviation and likely understandable in this context. The score of 4.0 takes into account the potential for improved context and the presence of a minor abbreviation. Overall, the metadata is largely accessible and provides a clear description of the item."
